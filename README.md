This piece of software is my personal file and backup management tool.

### So um... What does it do?

I'm still writing this tool and figuring out all of its uses.

Currently it has the following features:

- Directory Flattener

### Can I help?

This is primarily a tool that I myself use, but if you have any suggestions, bug reports, or even pull requests, then go ahead. :relaxed:

### Where's the cool image from?

It's [one of the wallpapers](https://wallhaven.cc/w/vm8dmp) on wallhaven.
